# Snake
It has been 25 years since the game 'Snake' was first launched on a Nokia 3310 mobile phone!
That phone shipped out 160 million units, and only had 3 games on it- Snake, Memory and Rotation. It was one of the most played games of that era- and one of my first game addictions when I got my first phone!

Play a cuter version of this classic retro mobile phone game in your web browser using your keyboard! 

1. Press any key to start as Player 1. 
2. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to guide the direction of the snake to eat the food.
3. Avoid the running into the wall and/or running into the body of the snake. 
4. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer AND the time interval speeds up by 10% which eventually makes it harder for the snake to avoid the wall or part of its body.
5. Once your Player 1's turn ends, Player 2 can start by pressing any button. 6. Winner has the higher score! Scores update while game is running and remain after both turns end
7. Press RESTART button beneath the game board to start new game
8. Enjoy & good luck! (My high score is 19)
