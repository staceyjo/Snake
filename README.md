# Snake
It has been 25 years since the game 'Snake' was first launched on a Nokia 3310 mobile phone! Play a cuter version of this classic retro mobile phone game in your web browser using your keyboard! Use the arrow keys to guide the direction of the snake to eat the food and avoid the walls AND your ever-growing tail.

Notes about my game: 

This game was originally released in 1999- on the Nokia 3210. That phone shipped out 160 million units, and only had 3 games on it- Snake, Memory and Rotation. It was one of the most played games of that era- and one of my first phone game addictions when I got my first phone in the early 2000s!

The game consists of controlling a very hungry snake element with your keyboard to "catch" the food (an apple or a cute rat png will appear on the screen). 

Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake to eat and avoid the walls.

For each item the snake eats, it grows longer which eventually makes it harder for the snake to avoid the wall or part of its body. 

Each time the player eats, the snake will move faster. 

The game will end if the player runs into the walls (gameboard border) or if the snake turns in on itself.
