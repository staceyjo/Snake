# Snake
Play the classic retro mobile phone game in your web browser! Guide the snake towards the food but avoid your ever-growing tail. This game was created using VS Code, CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

Notes about my game: 
The game consists of controlling a very hungry snake element to catch "fruits" (made of a few pixels each) without crashing in the walls or turning in on itself. Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake to eat and avoid the walls. 

This game was originally released in 1999- on the Nokia 3210. That phone shipped out 160 million units, and only had 3 games on it- Snake, Memory and Rotation. It was one of the most played games of that era- and one of my first phone game addictions when I got my first phone in the early 2000s!

For each item the snake eats, it grows longer which eventually makes it harder for the snake to avoid the wall or part of its body. 

If the snake hits a wall or part of its body, that ends the game.
