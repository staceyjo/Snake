Remember:
If you didn’t complete your game. It’s okay! BREATHE! It is common for many to not finish.
Practice selling yourself, love your craft, and pretend you’re presenting to your future employer.

Do not sell yourself short. Only show things that are working or present positively if nothing is working. 

Save all the technical challenges towards the end.

Have your code ready on your screen, and your game running on the browser. 

Be prepared!

Respect, boundaries, rules, and expectations still apply.
